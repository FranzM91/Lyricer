{"name":"Lyricer","tagline":"The LRC lyrics parser and shower for the web","body":"Lyricer\r\n=======\r\nThis is a simple standalone javascript library to parse and show LRC lyric in a web page.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nInclude the js and css file in your page.\r\n```html\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyricer-1.0.0.js\"></script>\r\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lyricer-1.0.0.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your js code, you can  create a Lyricer object, provding the LRC string as the argument, or leave it empty, it can be set/change later.\r\n```javascript\r\n    var lrc = new Lyricer(lrctext);\r\n    var lrc = new Lyricer();\r\n    lrc.setLrc(lrctext);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your page, you need to create an empty div with the default id 'lyricer'. The id can be changed through js code. This div is to place the html lyric.\r\n```html\r\n    <div id=\"lyricer\"></div>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\n    lrc.divID = \"yourid\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main method is to move to a specific time in seconds. The following line moves the html lyric in your page to the line when the song plays at time 100 seconds.\r\n```javascript\r\n    lrc.move(100);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsually, you can create a function object around the move method and bind it to the timeupdate event of an audio, for example,\r\n```javascript\r\n    audio.addEventListener( \"timeupdate\", function() {\r\n\t\tlrc.move(audio.currentTime);\r\n\t} );\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
